Recursion is a programming technique in which you describe actions to be repeated using a method that calls itself

< Elements >
    1. Base case
        - A case within a recursive solutio nthat is so simple that it can be solved directly without a recursive call
    2. Recurisve case
        - A case within a recursive solution that invovles reducing the overall problem to a simpler problem of the same kind that can be solved by a recurisve call
    3. Call Stack
        - The internal structure thatkeeps track of the sequence of methods that have been called
    4. Prefix Evaluator
        1) Infix - <number1> <operator> <number2>
        2) Prefix - <operator> <number1> <number2>
            = functional notation
               - example) + 3.5 8.2 = plus(3.5, 8.2) if represneted with a function
        3) Postfix - <number1> <number2> <operator>
            = reverse Polish notation
    
        
- Example 1)
  public static void writeStars(int n){
    if (n == 0) {
      System.out.println();
    }else{
      System.out.print("*");
      writeStarts(n - 1);
    }
  }

- Example 2)
  public static int pow(int x, int y){
    if (y == 0){
      // base case with y == 0
      return 1;
    }else if (y < 0){
      throw new IllegalArgumentException("negative exponent: " + y);
    }else{
      // recursive case with y > 0
      return x * pow(x, y - 1);
    }
  }
